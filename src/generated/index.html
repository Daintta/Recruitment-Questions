Context changes: If a component is consuming values from a React context using useContext (in functional components), and the context value changes, the component will re-render.<br>5. Using hooks with dependencies: Hooks like useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback accept dependency arrays as their second argument. When any of the listed dependencies change, the effect will run, or the memoized value or callback will be recomputed, potentially causing the component to re-render.</td>

They are server-side functions that run when a request is made to their corresponding URL. To create an API route, simply create a new file with a .js extension inside the pages/api folder, and export a default request handler function.</td>
