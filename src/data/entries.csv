,lang_py,Can you explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?,"A list is a mutable sequence of elements, while a tuple is an immutable sequence of elements. This means that you can add, remove, or modify elements in a list, but not in a tuple.",1
,lang_py,When would you use a set over a list or tuple?,"You would use a set when you're interested in whether you have seen certain data before, sets have faster access speeds than lists because they use hashing.<br><br>BONUS: mention of set O(1) vs list/tuple O(n)",1
,lang_py,How do you handle errors in Python code?,"try, except block", 1
,lang_py,What is your experience with object-oriented programming in Python?,"Looking for talk of classes, objects, inheritance, composition, polymorphism",1
,lang_py,Can you explain how Python's garbage collector works? (What is a garbage collector?),"Python's garbage collector is responsible for automatically freeing up memory that is no longer being used by a program. It works by periodically identifying and removing objects that are no longer being referenced by the program, freeing up the associated memory for other uses.<br><br>BONUS: talks about reference counting",2
,lang_py,What does the yield keyword do?,Yield 'pauses' the function and can return a value without ending it. It is used for iterators and async programming,2
,lang_py,Do you know about the Python Global Interpreter Lock?,"Looking for something along the lines of ensuring Python only executes Python Bytecode one thread at a time. It is essentially a Mutex. Only one thread can be actively running something at a time.",2
,lang_py,When would you use threading (or async) in Python? How would you do parallel execution?,"Follow on from previous question. Threading is still useful when I/O bound code (writing to disk, communicating over network) as other code can execute whilst waiting.",2
,lang_py,What is the difference between Python and C?,"C is compiled, Python has a garbage collector, Python is dynamically typed whereas C is static, C can achieve better performance because it has less overhead",2
,lang_py,What is an iterator? Why would you use one?,"Iterators return data incrementally, this is useful when processing large amounts of data as the whole dataset doesn't need to be loaded into memory.",2
,lang_py,What libraries might you use for data science?,"Numpy, pandas.<br><br>Tensorflow, pytorch, keras, ibis, fastai are also acceptable.",1
,lang_py,What libraries or tools might you use to add some type safety to python?,"Pydantic, mypy",1
,lang_py,When might you use a profiler,"To identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies that aren’t obvious in the source code",2
,lang_py,Why is it a good idea to use a virtual environment? ,"- Package conflicts between projects<br>- Package conflicts with your host OS",2
,lang_py,"What are python’s strengths and weaknesses, in your opinion?","Strengths: Readability, flexibility, easy to learn , very large developer base, with a ton of libraries and APIs for basically anything you want<br>Weaknesses: Slow, Packaging isn’t great compared to a compiled language, Threading and GIL",2
