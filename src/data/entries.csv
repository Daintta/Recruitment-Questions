,lang_py,Can you explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?,"A list is a mutable sequence of elements, while a tuple is an immutable sequence of elements. This means that you can add, remove, or modify elements in a list, but not in a tuple.",1
,lang_py,When would you use a set over a list or tuple?,"You would use a set when you're interested in whether you have seen certain data before, sets have faster access speeds than lists because they use hashing.<br><br>BONUS: mention of set O(1) vs list/tuple O(n)",1
,lang_py,How do you handle errors in Python code?,"try, except block", 1
,lang_py,What is your experience with object-oriented programming in Python?,"Looking for talk of classes, objects, inheritance, composition, polymorphism",1
,lang_py,Can you explain how Python's garbage collector works? (What is a garbage collector?),"Python's garbage collector is responsible for automatically freeing up memory that is no longer being used by a program. It works by periodically identifying and removing objects that are no longer being referenced by the program, freeing up the associated memory for other uses.<br><br>BONUS: talks about reference counting",2
,lang_py,What does the yield keyword do?,Yield 'pauses' the function and can return a value without ending it. It is used for iterators and async programming,2
,lang_py,Do you know about the Python Global Interpreter Lock?,"Looking for something along the lines of ensuring Python only executes Python Bytecode one thread at a time. It is essentially a Mutex. Only one thread can be actively running something at a time.",2
,lang_py,When would you use threading (or async) in Python? How would you do parallel execution?,"Follow on from previous question. Threading is still useful when I/O bound code (writing to disk, communicating over network) as other code can execute whilst waiting.",2
,lang_py,What is the difference between Python and C?,"C is compiled, Python has a garbage collector, Python is dynamically typed whereas C is static, C can achieve better performance because it has less overhead",2
,lang_py,What is an iterator? Why would you use one?,"Iterators return data incrementally, this is useful when processing large amounts of data as the whole dataset doesn't need to be loaded into memory.",2
,lang_py,What libraries might you use for data science?,"Numpy, pandas.<br><br>Tensorflow, pytorch, keras, ibis, fastai are also acceptable.",1
,lang_py,What libraries or tools might you use to add some type safety to python?,"Pydantic, mypy",1
,lang_py,When might you use a profiler,"To identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies that aren't obvious in the source code",2
,lang_py,Why is it a good idea to use a virtual environment? ,"- Package conflicts between projects<br>- Package conflicts with your host OS",2
,lang_py,"What are python's strengths and weaknesses, in your opinion?","Strengths: Readability, flexibility, easy to learn , very large developer base, with a ton of libraries and APIs for basically anything you want<br>Weaknesses: Slow, Packaging isn't great compared to a compiled language, Threading and GIL",2
,lang_go,"What is one of the key advantages of Using Go for building applications?","- Cross-platform<br>- Compiles down to a single binary that includes the dependencies<br>- Automatic memory management",1
,lang_go,"What is a Goroutine in Go and how does it differ from a traditional thread?","- Lightweight concurrent execution unit enabling concurrent programming (multiple function to run independently and concurrently<br>- Multiple goroutines can run on a single OS thread in an interleaved manner<br>- Thread count is limited but allows true parallel execution of tasks<br>- Threads are heavier in terms of memory/resource consumption",2
,lang_go,"Explain what a race-condition is in the context of goroutines. How can you prevent race-conditions in Go?","- Occurs when multiple concurrent threads (or goroutines) access shared data simultaneously, and at least one of them modifies the data. The order and timing of these operations aren't guaranteed and so can lead to data-corruption, crashes or other unexpected behaviour.<br>- Prevent with proper synchronisation - Mutex to lock the data before editing it",2
,lang_go,"How would you handle communication across goroutines/threads?","- Can't just instantly use a function that's returned in a goroutine as you don't know when it's back. (Don't want a race-condition!)<br>- Goroutines - Use channels and other sync primitives so wait for the data<br>- Thread - Use mutexas, semaphores or other OS-sync mechanisms",2
,lang_go,"What's the difference between a buffered and an unbuffered channel in Go?","- An unbuffered channel has a capacity of zero, so can only hold a single value at a time<br>- When a value is sent to an unbuffered channel, the sender will block until another goroutine is ready to receive the value - Buffered only blocks when the buffer is full<br>- unbuffered - Receiving blocks until value, enforces synchronisation<br>- buffered - Receiving blocks if empty, allows for async (sender/receiver can proceed as long as buffer isn't full/empty)",3
,skill_frontend,"Explain your understanding of the DOM. Given this, explain the benefits of leveraging a virtual DOM in frontend development?","Virtual DOM is useful in frameworks like React by optimising the web component reloads. It also enables state to automatically get inherited by components without explicit assignments.",1
,skill_frontend,"Under what circumstances does a component re-render in React?","1. Changes in props<br>2. Changes in state<br>3. Parent component re-renders<br>4. Context changes: If a component is consuming values from a React context using useContext (in functional components), and the context value changes, the component will re-render.<br>5. Using hooks with dependencies: Hooks like useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback accept dependency arrays as their second argument. When any of the listed dependencies change, the effect will run, or the memoized value or callback will be recomputed, potentially causing the component to re-render.",1
,skill_frontend,"How can we prevent unnecessary rerenders in React?","- React.memo<br>- Use the hook dependencies correctly in useCallback, useEffect and useMemo to avoid re-renders<br>- For big forms, prefer useRef over useState",2
,skill_frontend,"In Next.js how do API routes work?","Next.js API routes provide a built-in solution for creating API endpoints within a Next.js application. They are server-side functions that run when a request is made to their corresponding URL. To create an API route, simply create a new file with a .js extension inside the pages/api folder, and export a default request handler function.",2
,skill_frontend,"In Next.js what is the advantage of using Serverless mode?","- Improved scalability, as serverless functions can automatically scale based on demand.<br>- Cost efficiency, as you only pay for the compute resources you actually use.<br>- Easier deployment and management, as you don't need to manage your own servers or infrastructure.<br>- Faster response times due to the serverless functions being deployed closer to the users.",3
,skill_frontend,"Given you are building a website with repetitive API calls for retrieving assets like images. Lets assume these images do not change much over time, what strategy could you think of to optimise these network calls for repeat users?","Caching<br><br>BONUS: use headers to determine whether to pull cached response or not",2
